      <p>We are members of the Multimedia Mission at the King's Gate United Church, a group of people working with others, to develop this website as well as a Bible app for sharing Bible quotes with the world!</p>
      <p>In developing the app our goal is to make it easy for people to discover and share Bible quotes that inspire and uplift them. We believe that the Bible is a powerful source of wisdom and guidance, and we want to make it more accessible to everyone.</p>
