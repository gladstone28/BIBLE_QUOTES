Up to this point this is a project from one of my lessons at Codecademy.com. I converted the original code to a tool that gives Bible verses. I would like to collaborate with a 
selected team of web developers to make this into an app that users can use to share selected Bible verses with each other depending on how they feel at any moment in time.
